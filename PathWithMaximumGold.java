 * 1219. Path with Maximum Gold
 * In a gold mine grid of size m * n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that
 * cell, 0 if it is empty.
 *
 * Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:
 *
 * Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
 * From your position you can walk one step to the left, right, up or down.
 * You can't visit the same cell more than once.
 * Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
 * You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.
