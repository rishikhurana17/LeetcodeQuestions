// 426. Convert Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly Linked List
// Convert a BST to a sorted circular doubly-linked list in-place. Think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the
// previous and next pointers in a doubly-linked list. We want to transform this BST into a circular doubly linked list. Each
// node in a doubly linked list has a predecessor and successor. For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first
// element is the last element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.

                root = root.left;
            }

            root = stack.pop();

            //firstNode will be set when we visit the first leftmost leaf
