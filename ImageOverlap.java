/**
 * @author Rishi Khurana
 * Two images A and B are given, represented as binary, square matrices of the same size.  (A binary matrix has only
 * 0s and 1s as values.)
 *
 * We translate one image however we choose (sliding it left, right, up, or down any number of units), and place it
 * on top of the other image.  After, the overlap of this translation is the number of positions that have a 1 in
 * both images.
 *
 * (Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation.)
 *
 * What is the largest possible overlap?
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: A = [[1,1,0],
 *             [0,1,0],
 *             [0,1,0]]
 *        B = [[0,0,0],
 *             [0,1,1],
 *             [0,0,1]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We slide A to right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit.
