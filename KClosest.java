// Q658 K closest points to the given value
// Given a sorted array, two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x in the array.
// The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the smaller elements are always preferred.

//	In the following solutions, it is assumed that all elements of array are distinct.
//	A simple solution is to do linear search for k closest elements.
//	1) Start from the first element and search for the crossover point (The point before which elements are smaller than or equal to X and after which elements are greater). This step takes O(n) time.
//	2) Once we find the crossover point, we can compare elements on both sides of crossover point to print k closest elements. This step takes O(k) time.
